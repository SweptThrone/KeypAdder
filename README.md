# KeypAdder
Adds the ability to attach keypads to standard prop doors.  
⚠️ This addon was never finished and was not tested enough.  I'm releasing it anyway with some notices.  

## What is this?  
KeypAdder adds a weapon - The KeypAdder - that allows you to attach keypads to prop doors, which control their locking and unlocking.  This addon also includes a unique Keypad Cracker and a Keypad Remover.  

## How do I use it?
Drop the KeypAdder_addon folder into your addons folder.  Connecting clients will need the material files.  

## Important notices
This addon was not tested enough, is missing features, and may not be terribly efficient.  You're encouraged to contribute and/or report issues.  
Despite mentioning some things about DarkRP, this doesn't support DarkRP very well.  Any player will be able to remove any keypad.  This isn't horribly hard to implement, I just didn't get around to it.
